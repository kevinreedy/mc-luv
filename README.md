Have you ever had to fly from the San Francisco Bay area to Washington DC on Southwest Airlines? If so, you probably know there are two airports you can fly from and three airports you can fly into. Searching for the best flight in this case is a chore. This is a quick and dirty tool to search for flights with multiple origin and destination airports and return all flights on one page.

To run locally, cd into this directory, run `bundle install`, and run `shotgun`.

Contributions are more than welcome!
